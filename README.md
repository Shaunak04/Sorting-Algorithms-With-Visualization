### üß†Algorithms implemented:
 - [x] Bubble Sort
 - [x] Insertion Sort
 - [x] Counting Sort
 - [x] Merge Sort
 - [x] Quick Sort
 - [x] Selection Sort
 - [ ] Heap sort
 - [ ] Shell sort
 - [ ] Timsort
 - [ ] Bucket sort
 - [ ] Comb sort

This is a project under development and all algorithms have not been 
implemented. You can contribute by implementing the un-checked algorithms
___
üíªTo contribute to this project, Follow the steps below:

 1. Fork the repository
 2. In the "Sorting_python folder" create a new `.py` file (e.g `timsort.py`)
 3. Write the timsort algorithm and call the function to visualise the algorithm at the end of each iteration (refer other `.py` files to understand the function call)
 4. In the `main.py` file include the sorting algorithm
 5. In the Tkinter sorting algorithm selection menu, add the label for your algorithm.
 6. Stage and commit the changes to your local repository.
 7. Create a pull request for merging it with the original source code
